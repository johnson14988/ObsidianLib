Let $A$ and $B$ be sets, a map $f$ is homomorphic if, for every operator $\omega \in \Omega_A$, there exists a corresponding operator $\omega^{\prime} \in \Omega_B$ such that the following condition holds:
$$
f\left(\omega\left(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\right)\right)=\omega^{\prime}\left(f\left(a_1\right), f\left(a_2\right), \ldots, f\left(a_n\right)\right) \quad \text { for all } a_i \in A
$$

> [!NOTE]
> If a structure is equipped with identity element which can be considered as a nullary operator, the identity element will be preserved as well.
